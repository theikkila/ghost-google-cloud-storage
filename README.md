# Ghost Google Cloud Storage Plugin 
A simple plugin to add Google Cloud Storage support for a Ghost Blog. 

## Installation
```bash
cd /var/www/ghost # or wherever you ran ghost-cli, this is your ghost base directory
npm install --save ghost-google-cloud-storage-new
```
Note that if you do not have a `package.json` file in your ghost base directory, this will warn. You do not need to add one, the `node_modules` directory will be created and populated either way. You can create one by running `npm init`.

## Create storage module
```bash
# This assumes that you are operating on your production environemnt, change the following variable if necessary.
export GHOST_ENVIRONMENT=production
# Your content path will be determined by your config file: https://docs.ghost.org/v1.0/docs/config#section-paths
# You can run the jq command to get it for you
export CONTENT_PATH=$(jq -r '.paths.contentPath // "."' config.${GHOST_ENVIRONMENT}.json)
mkdir -p ${CONTENT_PATH}/adapters/storage/gcloud
cat > ${CONTENT_PATH}/adapters/storage/gcloud/index.js << EOL
'use strict';
module.exports = require('ghost-google-cloud-storage-new');
EOL
```

## Configuration

Create a bucket in your google cloud project. In the storage settings you will find your project id as `x-goog-project-id`, after that you need to go to your [API Credentials](https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/credentials) settings and create a `Service account key`, choosing `JSON` as the key type.

Add this key on your root ghost folder or any folder you want.

Add a `storage` block to your `config.${GHOST_ENVIRONMENT}.json` as below:

```json
"storage": {
    "active": "gcloud",
    "gcloud": {
        "projectId": "Your_project_id",
        "key": "Your_key_path",
        "bucket": "Your_bucket_name",
        "assetDomain": "domain-for-bucket.example.com",
        "insecure": true,
        "maxAge": "2678400"
    }
}
```

Notes:
- For the key path, if it is in the ghost root directory, just use the name of the file. Otherwise use an absolute path.
- The `assetDomain` is an optional config entry, and is only required if you want to use a [custom domain](https://cloud.google.com/storage/docs/hosting-static-website) for your cloud storage bucket. Note that these instructions only allow for http, not https, as the storage servers do not present a custom certificate for your domain. Here is a [list of workarounds](https://cloud.google.com/storage/docs/static-website#https). Pair with the `"insecure": true` option to use bare http URLs.
- The `insecure` config is also optional, and defaults to false. Set to true if you are using a custom asset domain, and do not have https configured.
- The `maxAge` is an optional config entry, and is only required if you want to set the cache-control's max age property. It defaults to 31 days (in seconds). This is desirable if you will not be deleting and re-uploading the same file multiple times, and will reduce your bandwidth usage when paired with a CDN. It can be overridden to set the max age to something else, smaller if you would like cache entries to be revalidated quicker, larger if you would like the cache entries to last for longer than 1 month.

## Verify Ghost config
```bash
ghost stop
ghost run
```
You will see some logs or an error if the install was not successful. Fix any errors and then run `ghost run` again until you see the `Ghost boot` log entry.

## Restart ghost
```bash
ghost start
```

### Here is a transcript of the above, with errors
```bash

user@ghost:/var/www/ghost$ ghost stop
